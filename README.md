### Business and Data Understanding
***
Our Data contains information of home sales in kings county. The data has a mixture of numerical and categorical data. As the data extends only about a year of homesales we will not utilize a time series analysis but focus more on linear regression. The dataset includes features such as, grade, condition, zipcode, greenbelt, heating, sewage, and square footage. This is all provided by King County as an effort to make data more accessible. From the website __[King County website](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/services/data)__:
>"King County is committed to making data open, accessible and transparent. The following data resources are designed to increase public access to high value, machine readable datasets from various departments in King County government."
